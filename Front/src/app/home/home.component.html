                Food Rescue is a vital initiative aimed at reducing food waste and redistributing surplus food to those in need. By connecting businesses with charities, we can help feed those who are food insecure while simultaneously helping to reduce the amount of food that ends up in landfills.

                Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted, contributing to environmental degradation and food scarcity. Through community engagement and awareness, we can educate people about the importance of food rescue and how they can participate in these efforts.
